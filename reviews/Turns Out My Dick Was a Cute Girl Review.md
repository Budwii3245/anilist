\# \_\_Introduction\_\_

Since the dawn of history man has always had one thing by his side. Not women, not nature, and not basic necessities like food and water. He had his cock and balls. A man has them from birth and they will never leave his side unless by force. 

One brave manga artist by the name of Unichiri decided to take this connection and combine it with his fixation on dubiously aged oriental drawings. And lo and behold it was a match made in heaven. 

Beginning serialization in March of this year "Ore no Kokan wa Bishoujo Datta no ka" or as it is commonly referred to "Turns Out My Dick Was a Cute Girl" is a short-form manga by mangaka Unichiri. It follows the adventures of protagonist Ayuriku Kosuga as he deals with the results of his genitalia becoming a cute girl.

\# \_\_Plot\_\_

As the title implies the manga mainly focuses on the daily antics of our protagonist and his now sentient and humanized penis who he has dubbed Chinko-chan. You would think such an outlandish premise would grow stale quickly, but the author has taken special care to ensure that he never repeats himself. 

Every chapter takes on a different scenario that our hero and Chinko-chan find themselves in from playing games

to taking his dick out for some fresh air and sunshine at the risk of police intervention.

The scenarios have only increased in quality with every chapter, and I have full confidence that Unichiri will be able to keep this level of quality up for at least the length of Detective Conan at a bare minimum.

\# \_\_Characters\_\_

The author is a true master of visual characterization and understands the most nuanced levels of "show don't tell" as he proves time and time again. 

Take for instance Chinko-chan's disguise. The subtle reference to a censored penis is both tasteful and hilarious both in and out of context. No words needed.

One thing that was clear to me is the author is delivering a vivid and powerful message with this work. He's telling you to stop jacking off six times a day and touch some grass. Why do I say this? It's simple. He visualizes the penis as a cute girl and in an almost girlfriend role for our protagonist. You would never beat your girlfriend, I hope. The author is telling us that jacking off is tantamount to domestic abuse of your johnson and to stop immediately. Listen to him for he speaks naught but the truth.

The interactions between Ayuriku and Chinko-chan always hit and can go from hilarious to heartwarming in the span of a single panel. For instance, this

is immediately followed up by this

I wept for Chinko-chan. I knew the pain of not being able to go outside with my cock and taters exposed to the fresh afternoon breeze. The author knows how to write relatable characters and he doesn't cut corners while doing so. 

Tied into the characters and their dynamic is the absolutely amazing comedic writing. As you can already tell from what I've shared the author is a wizard of scenario creation and knows exactly when and how to execute jokes.

He never misses and every chapter brings with it new jokes and fresh ideas that spice things up. Mangaka should take notes as I think Unichiri is setting the standard for comedy with how consistent he's been and will doubtless continue to be.

\# \_\_Conclusion\_\_

Talking about the art extensively is not worthwhile as you've already gotten a taste of the art through the panels I've shared. Every one of them belongs in a museum and Unichiri doubtless stands with the greats of Yusuke Murata and Takehiko Inoue when it comes to expressing emotion and detail in his art (why does he actually have a better grasp of shading than Ikemoto does in 95% of Boruto chapters?) 

I would like to credit @Bangtoib45 @FerrisGD and @muflantur @SixSidedShape as my fellow penile disciples who have walked alongside me to this blessed day. May Unichiri-sensei gift us all even a fraction of his wisdom.
